                <h3>The Miracle of Istanbul</h3>
                <p>
                    The 2005 UEFA Champions League Final was the final match of the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League, Europe's primary club football competition. 
                    The showpiece event was contested between Liverpool of England and Milan of Italy at the Atatürk Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey on <time datatime="2005-05-25">25 May 2005</time>. 
                    Liverpool, who had won the competition four times, were appearing in their sixth final, and their first since 1985. 
                    Milan, who had won the competition six times, were appearing in their second final in three years and tenth overall. 
                    Milan were regarded as favourites before the match and took the lead within the first minute through captain Paolo Maldini. 
                    Milan striker Hernán Crespo added two more goals before half-time to make it 3–0.
                    In the second half Liverpool launched a comeback and scored three goals in a dramatic six-minute spell to level the scores at 3–3, with goals from Steven Gerrard, Vladimír Šmicer and Xabi Alonso. 
                    The scores remained the same during extra time, and a penalty shoot-out was required to decide the champions. 
                    The score was 3–2 to Liverpool when Andriy Shevchenko's penalty was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek. 
                    Thus Liverpool won their fifth European Cup, were awarded the trophy permanently, and claimed a multiple-winner badge. 
                    Liverpool's comeback gave rise to the final being known as the Miracle of Istanbul, and is regarded as one of the greatest finals in the history of the tournament.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fans were singing the club's anthem <mark>“You'll Never Walk Alone”</mark>. 
                    Legend has it that the motivating effect of the fans singing <mark>“You'll Never Walk Alone”</mark> gave the players hope when all seemed lost. 
                    This small act of defiance in the face of adversity galvanised the Liverpool team, 
                    and they managed to pull back and win the match on penalties, crowning them European Cup Champions.

                        When you walk through a storm<br>
                        Hold your head up high<br>
                        And don't be afraid of the dark<br>
                        At the end of a storm<br>
                        There's a golden sky<br>
                        And the sweet silver song of a lark<br>
                        Walk on through the wind<br>
                        Walk on through the rain<br>
                        Though your dreams be tossed and blown<br>
                        Walk on, walk on<br>
                        With hope in your heart<br>
                        And you'll never walk alone<br>
                        You'll never walk alone<br>
                        Walk on, walk on<br>
                        With hope in your heart<br>
                        And you'll never walk alone<br>
                        You'll never walk alone<br>
